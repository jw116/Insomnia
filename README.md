# **_Insomnia_**

*Insomnia* is a Python-based game about clearing a mind troubled by persistent memories. In this dreamlike journey, players observe the movements of paper cranesâ€”elusive symbols of memory that vanish upon waking. The challenge lies in predicting and capturing their paths to progress through the game. 

The game features two modes:
- **Story Mode**: Experience a narrative-driven journey through memory and growth.
- **Zen Mode**: An endless mode for relaxing gameplay.
